# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Is the use of programming language to creat things like websites and apps.It has help businesses run smoothly and reach more customers not only that it has developed important apps and website's that are important in dsy to day activities.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
.The creation of high level programing languages wich made it much easier for people to code
.The development of object oriented programming it changed how we design software and let us creat reusable codes that's much easier to maintain.
.The rise of open source movement it transformed software development by encouraging collaboration and sharing of codes

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. 
.The planning phase  here budget and timeline for the project is set
.The requirement phase here sketches or mockups are made
. Development phase here actually coding takes place 
. Testing phase here any bugs found are fixed 
.Deploiment phase here the software is realised to the users

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
.Both waterfall and Agile are project management methodologies
.Contrast is that waterfall is more rigid unlike Agile wich is more flexible 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
.A software developer use codes to figure out the most efficient way to make product idea's work.
.A quality assurance engineer think like the user to find any possible problem.
.A project manager they sometimes make decisions o the fly to solve problems that come up.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
. Integrated development environment make coding faster and less frustrating example is the visual studio code while the version control system keeps codes safe example the Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
.The pressure to deliver higher quality software on tight deadlines 
.Dealing with constant shifting project requirements. 
. Keeping up with all the changes in technology.
-some strategies they use to overcome these challenges include 
.They focuse on continuous learning 
.Use alot of project management techniques 
.Rely on teamwork and communication 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
.using a scenario of building a wall
.unit we will test each brick
. integration we join the bricks
. system we test the whole wall to see if it can support the weight needed
.acceptance having someone inspect  the whole wall .This testing helps find and fix problems earlier wich saves time


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
.Is crafting the perfect questions or requests to get the best results from an AI this is important because it help the AI get better at things like providing information and completing task 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
a.write about a cat
b.write a short story about a grumpy cat who lives in abig city and hates dogs 
.The second prompt is more effective because it gives  the AI specific details to work with like the cat's personality and where it lives.
